# PrizePicks
Project Goal: Develop a comprehensive betting analyzer and predictor for PrizePicks. This tool will use data from ESPN and PrizePicks to generate high-confidence 2-man, 3-man, and 4-man bet combinations with at least a 50% probability of hitting. Using machine learning, the analyzer will learn from past bets to improve the accuracy of future predictions.

Project Overview:

Data Collection: Automatically retrieve player performance stats for the last 20 games from ESPN and collect current betting lines from PrizePicks. Ensure that data is cleaned and filtered to include only games where the player actively participated.
Bet Generation: Generate ten 2-man, 3-man, and 4-man bet combinations based on statistical probabilities. Each generated bet will have at least a 50% chance of hitting.
Machine Learning Integration: Implement a machine learning model to learn from historical bet outcomes, adapting and refining predictions based on past results. The model will improve its accuracy over time by identifying patterns and successful bet combinations.
User-Friendly Interface: Present bet recommendations in an easy-to-read format, with probabilities, player names, and recommended bet combinations ranked by confidence.
Features:

Automated Data Fetching - Pull real-time player stats from ESPN and betting lines from PrizePicks.
Statistical Analysis - Calculate probabilities for each bet combination to ensure a high likelihood of success.
Machine Learning Model - Train on historical data to predict which combinations are most likely to hit in the future.
Bet Recommendation System - Provide 10 top-ranked bet suggestions for 2-man, 3-man, and 4-man combinations.
This project will provide a valuable tool for analyzing and predicting PrizePicks bets, combining data science, machine learning, and real-time sports statistics.
